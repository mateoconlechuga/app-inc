**THIS REPOSITORY IS ARCHIVED**, however an updated version of `app.inc` can be found here: https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium/blob/master/include/app.inc

## Building

You can build the example application using the following line with `fasmg`: (Available for your os near the bottom of [this page](https://flatassembler.net/download.php).)

    ./fasmg src/execlib.asm execlib.8xp

You can find an example application in `src/execlib.asm`.

Inside the `include` directory you will find `app.inc`; which is where all the magic happens.
